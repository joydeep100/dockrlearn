An example for docker compose.

Task.
- Build a container having redis-client
- Create a docker-compose file defining both redis-server and redis-client and connect the client to the server
- To ensure connection is success, put a key and retrieve the key value and put it in a shared volume file

Solution.

1. Create the redis-client build

- docker build . --tag <docker_id>/<image_name>:<tag - optional>

ex. docker build . --tage joydeep56053/redis-client:latest 

2. Pull the redis-server image 

- docker pull redis

3. Create the docker-compose.yml file	//Specification for this is beyond the scope of this file, refer docker docs.

4. Run docker compose

- docker-compose up

5. Check if the file 'output.txt' is created in '/root/docker' path in local. (Ensure this path has necessary permissions)

The content of this file should be '123'
