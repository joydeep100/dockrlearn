Docker compose is used when we want to interlink various running containers.

It is very useful since it automatically creates the network related settings 
so that containers can easily talk to each other.

One thing to note is to croos connect a port on a diff. container we have to use
the `service name` as the `host name` of the container we are trying to connect.

#Commands

- docker-compose up	//start all containers as in docker-compose.yml file

- docker-compose up --build	//to rebuild the conatiners defined in the docker-compose.yml file

- docker-compose down	//stop all the containers
