Using a multi step docker builder, we can take the output / processed data 
from one build and pass it to another, without the overhead of the entire process.
Since the builder part is just a idependent part of the process, we can make sure
the end conatiner is as concise as possible.

In the given example, in the builder part we generate the /app/build files.
Which is a requirement for the Runner part.

So we can phase this into multi step.
